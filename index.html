        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Traditional interferometric methods, such as those used by Mach-Zehnder and others, produce polarization vortices, but they are complex and only generate one vortex at a time. In our experiment, using a simple Sagnac interferometer, we were able to simultaneously generate two orthogonal polarization vortices. Moreover, we can switch between two different pairs of vortices. This advancement opens up new possibilities for applications in optical communication/mode division multiplexing, laser micromachining, particle trapping, and other fields that require precise polarization control.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel scheme generating pairs of orthogonal polarization vortices. A pair of radially and azimuthally polarized beams is produced in two Sagnac interferometer arms. The technique allows for reconfiguring the output polarization by rotating an intracavity wave plate or adjusting the input polarization.</p>

        <h2>Methodology: Generation of Reconfigurable Pairs of Orthogonal Polarization Vortices Using a Sagnac Interferometer</h2>

        <h3>1. Experimental Setup</h3>
        <p>The experiment was conducted using a Sagnac interferometer (SI) equipped with a spiral phase plate (SPP) and a quarter-wave plate (QWP). The system was configured to generate and manipulate cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) by controlling the polarization state within the interferometer.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laser Source:</strong> A 633 nm HeNe laser was used to provide a coherent and stable light source.</li>
            <li><strong>Optical Components:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beam Splitters (BS1 & BS2): Used to split and recombine the beam inside the interferometer.</li>
                    <li>Mirrors (M): Redirected the counterpropagating beams along the defined optical paths.</li>
                    <li>Quarter-Wave Plate (QWP) & Half-Wave Plate (HWP): Controlled the polarization of the beams.</li>
                    <li>Spiral Phase Plate (SPP): Introduced phase modulation to create vortex beams.</li>
                    <li>Vortex Phase Plate (Viavi Solutions Inc.): Used for fine control over different vortex orders.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Beam Manipulation Process</h3>
        <p>The Sagnac interferometer was configured to generate two pairs of orthogonal polarization vortices through controlled phase and polarization modulation.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The QWP was set at a 45° angle to the interferometer’s SI plane, creating radially and azimuthally polarized beams at the output.</li>
            <li>By rotating the QWP by 90°, the system was reconfigured to generate a different set of saddle-mode polarization vortices.</li>
            <li>Additionally, a half-wave plate (HWP) set at 45° inside the interferometer was introduced to interchange the vortex beam outputs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Measurement and Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The generated beams were analyzed at both the reflection and transmission ports of the interferometer.</li>
            <li>The polarization structure was examined by placing a polarization analyzer at different orientations.</li>
            <li>Simulation results were compared with experimental data to validate the theoretical predictions.</li>
            <li>Multiple experiments were conducted with different topological charges (l = 1, 2, 4) to assess the consistency of the polarization vortex generation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Results Validation</h3>
        <p>Experimental results showed high agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the feasibility of using this setup for dynamically reconfigurable optical beams.</p>
        <p>The reconfiguration method (by rotating QWP, HWP, or changing input polarization) demonstrated efficient mode-switching, making the technique suitable for applications in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Optical communication/mode division multiplexing</li>
            <li>Laser micromachining</li>
            <li>Optical trapping and manipulation</li>
        </ul>
